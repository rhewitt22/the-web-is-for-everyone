							<p>In 2014 the Museum of Modern Art in New York City had an exhibit with an updated symbol for accessibility. Designers Tim Ferguson-Saunder, Brian Glenney and Sara Hendren, introduced a new, grassroots icon in Boston by placing stickers featuring the updated graphic over signs with the old wheelchair symbol.</p>

						<h2>Let's start with some definitions</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>This is not a laundry list of best practices, if you have specific questions I’m happy to answer as many as I can at the end of the talk. Feel free to interrupt me throughout the presentation, I don't bite.</p>

					<section>
						<blockquote>Search engine optimization (SEO) is often about making small modifications to parts of your website. When viewed individually, these changes might seem like incremental improvements, but when combined with other optimizations, they could have a noticeable impact on your site's user experience and performance in organic search results.</blockquote>
						<p>&mdash; <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451184?hl=en">Google</a></p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<blockquote>Accessibility is the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible — we traditionally think of this as being about people with disabilities, but really it also covers other groups such as those using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections.</blockquote>
						<p> &mdash; <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/What_is_accessibility">Mozilla</a></p>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>The open web is one of the greatest equilizers of all time. People with disabilities often have difficulties moving through physical space. If we do our jobs correctly those barriers are lowered when it comes to information. The greatest promise of the web is that anyone can learn just about anything.</p>

							<p>We also know that accessibility is the law of the land. ADA.gov features a list of the most recent court settlements levied against government agencies and private companies who fail to comply with Section 508.</p>

						<h2>Impairments</h2>
						<br>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Visual</strong> - Blindness/low vision, color blindness</li>
							<li><strong>Auditory</strong> - Deafness, degenerative hearing loss</li>
							<li><strong>Mobility</strong> - Paralysis, stroke, MS</li>
							<li><strong>Cognition</strong> - Epilepsy, autism</li>
						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Some impairments are permanent &mdash; others are temporary. As Mozilla implied in their definition if we think of this in terms of impairments we can be more inclusive of the realities of an increasingly distracted world</p>

						<h2>The link between SEO and Accessibility</h2>

						<img src="./lib/img/seo-accessibility-logo.jpg" alt="A logo combining the letters SEO with an image of an individual in a wheelchair" style="max-height: 35vh;">

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Accessibility and search engine optimization are often treated as two separate concerns, but they’re more closely linked than you might think.</p>

							<p>In both cases, as content creators or developers, we need to clearly mark up our pages using the appropriate elements such that machines can parse and understand our message. Our pages need to be machine-readable and cannot rely solely on the visual display of information, something sighted users often take for granted.</p>

							<p>In the end, adhering to accessibility and SEO best practices will result in disseminating our messages to a wider, more inclusive audience.</p>

						<h2>Starting with semantics</h2>

						<!-- <img src="./lib/img/unsemantic.jpg" alt="An example of poorly crafted HTML that dictates style rather than content" style="width: 50%;"> -->
						<img src="./lib/img/semantic.jpg" alt="An example of well crafted HTML that describes the content accurately" style="width: 50%;">

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Both SEO and accessibility call for developers and content creators to start with a semantic HTML base. The proper use of HTML tags give hints to the machines about what content is interactive and what’s most important.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>The right tool for the job</h2>

						<div class="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/pughsplant/status/784773766127710208"></div>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Semantic HTML is akin to using the right tool for the job. You (hopefully) wouldn’t try to drive a nail with a flathead screwdriver (unless you were really desperate, I’ve been there). While it’s possible to teach a plain old DIV how to change the address bar to another website using javascript, it makes a lot more sense to use an anchor tag, which was designed for this exact purpose.</p>

							<p>Likewise, the text we include in these elements is important. Search engines place a higher value on content included in title, heading, button and link elements.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<img src="./lib/img/html5.png" alt="HTML5 logo" style="max-height: 60vh;">

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>With the advent of HTML5, web developers got fancy new set of tools to work with. No longer is everything a DIV! We have header, nav, main, section, article, footer, etc. Each of these elements brings with them certain intrinsic meaning that can give clues about our content to our users and search engines. Screen readers understand these elements and provide tools to quickly jump between these different landmarks on a webpage.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Separation of concerns</h2>

						<img src="./lib/img/separation-of-concerns.png" alt="Icons for the three pilars of web development: HTML, CSS and JavaScript" style="padding: 1.5rem;">

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>While certain HTML elements empart specific styles (headings are, by default, larger than paragraph text) they should be used to describe content and not used to style pages. With CSS we can make our pages and the elements therein appear in any way we want. This can be a hard habit to break, but it makes a world of difference.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Proper use of headings</h2>

						<img src="./lib/img/scrollnav.jpg" alt="A screenshot of a scrollnav on the Southeast region website. The tool allows users to quickly jump between section headings." style="max-height: 50vh;">

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Headings are great for naming different sections of content within a page. Search engines understand that text in headings are a signal of importance. They  use this information to score those pages more highly than a different page that uses the same terminology in a div or paragraph tag.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Proper use of buttons and links</h2>

						<img src="./lib/img/bad-link-text.jpg" alt="An example of poor link text -- the word 'here' is highlighted.">
						<p><a href="https://www.wolfcreek.gov/VisitorCenter">Wolf Creek NFH</a></p>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Buttons and links are inherently interactive. By default, users can tab through all of these elements on any web page, which is especially useful for users that have difficulty navigating the web with a mouse or trackpad. This makes it easy to jump between interactive elements on the page. You can activate a focused button or link with the spacebar or enter key on your keyboard, untethering you from your mouse.</p>

							<p>I like highlight noun text when using links (recovery plan, fact sheet, etc.) and verbs when I'm using a button (Submit, open, close).</p>

						<h2>Mobile friendly design</h2>

						<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; height: 60vh;">
							<img src="./lib/img/ngn-desktop.jpg" alt="Desktop layout for the Nature's good neighbors campaign website" style="padding-right: 3rem;">
							<img src="./lib/img/ngn-mobile.jpg" alt="Desktop layout for the Nature's good neighbors campaign website">
						</div>

						<p>In 2016, Google adds <a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2016/11/mobile-first-indexing.html">mobile considerations</a> to it's search algorithm.</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Remember the early days of the iPhone? There were only five to ten apps, no app store, and the mobile web browsing experience was abysmal. Granted it was a revolutionary device, but the regular was was shrunk down to a 3 inch screen requiring users to pinch and zoom to try to tap a TINY link.</p>

							<p>Today we know how important mobile friendly design is. The NGN campaign website had about 50% of it's traffic from mobile devices. In the old days those folks wouldn't have bother sticking around long enough to read our contnet.</p>

							<p>Mobile friendly sites are easier to navigate thanks to larger click targets, mobile friendly navigation techniques and a reshuffling of content.</p>

							<p>In 2016, Google began to consider a site's mobile-friendlyness in it's search algorithm.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Performance</h2>

						<p><a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2018/01/using-page-speed-in-mobile-search.html">Google now considers site speed in search results</a>.</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Often overlooked, performance has a huge impact on all aspects of web development. A page that takes 30 seconds to load is not accessible to anyone whether or not they have an impairment.  Google has begun to move sites that load extremely slowly lower in their results.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Transcripts</h2>

						<ul>
							<li>Podcasts</li>
							<li>Audio files</li>
							<li>Video - 'Audio description'</li>
						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>When posting audio or video files you should always consider posting a transcript. Rather than typing something out in Word and posting as a PDF I recommend including the somewhere directly on your webpage. This will allow the search engine to index that content along with your video, which should result in more traffic than posting a separate transcript.</p>

						<h2>What about the CMS?</h2>

						<img src="./lib/img/cms-output.jpg" alt="An example of a page created by the new CMS" style="max-height: 60vh;">

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Many of us are here at NCTC to learn about the new intranet and public facing web platforms that are currently in development. You might be wondering how you can apply this knowledge as we shift to a new paradigm: the CMS.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Leveraging templates</h2>

						<img src="./lib/img/template-example.svg" alt="Different content files run through the same template to produce different news stories" style="max-height: 50vh; padding: 1rem;">

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>One of the benefits of using a CMS are that page templates are largely hidden from content producers. No longer are we hand-crafting pages with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Instead, we leave that to contractors at design agencies who are required to adhere to the requirements in Section 508.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Content creation</h2>

						<img src="./lib/img/content-creation.jpg" alt="A screenshot of a potential data entry for to produce content in the new CMS">

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Producing content for the CMS will be much more like filling out a standard web form. There will be fields for page title, tags, description, page content, etc. While employees will fill out a single form, the information provided will be used to generate a page using a series of page templates.</p>

							<p>Content producers will be able to fill out page metadata like page titles, descriptions, tags, etc. and have a content area that will be injected into our page templates. Knowing what we know now, we’ll need to use the editor’s premade options for inserting various headings (h1, h2s, h3s, etc.) into the rich text editor and be sure to include meaningful link text, while the majority of accessibility and SEO implementation will be abstracted away.  That’s not to say we can ignore what we’ve learned and everything will be peachy.</p>

						<h2>Auditing your work</h2>

					<section>
						<h2>Ever tried a screen reader?</h2>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>It's hard to know what it's like to navigate the web in a different way without trying for ourselves. Before we get into best practices, let's explore what it's like to use a screen reader.</p>

							<p>We often talk about building a user experience (UX) rather than a webpage. Users navigating the web with a screen reader are trying to achieve the same things as everyone else, they just have a completely different user experience. It's important to consider what impact our design decisions have on ALL of our users and not just those that are the most like us.</p>

							<p>Many of the small accessibility mistakes we make are out of ignorance, not malice. Firing up a screen reader for just a few minutes can highlight pain points and get you thinking about accessibility from the start.</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>What pain points did you notice?</p>

							<ul>
								<li>1. The link to the Service homepage announced "Logo" rather than indicating it would take you to the homepage</li>
								<li>2. The within-page navigation was announced to the reader because it was visually hidden, but not removed from the screenreader with display:none</li>
								<li>3. The photo caption/alt text was read aloud twice</li>

						<h2>Site Improve</h2>

							<li>Segment data by program or region</li>
							<li>Gamification: compete for the best score!</li>
							<li>Works best if you leverage templates</li>
						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Site improve scans fws.gov regularly to perform audits for accessibility, search engine optimization and overall site quality. By surfacing quantitative metrics and grouping content by program or region you can start some healthy competition to improve our site. The use of templates means that a change in one file can correct hundreds of accessibility or SEO erros at once.</p>

						<img src="./lib/img/site-improve-southeast.jpg" alt="" style="height: 30vh;">
						<p>*Data accessed on September 9, 2018</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Siteimprove allows us to compare our region or program to all of FWS.gov, to other regions, or to the Government average.</p>

							<p>Notice below the scores Site Improve mentions the areas where a single error that occurs on many pages can have a huge impact on your score. The software does a great job of identifying simple fixes that can have the greatest impact on your scores.</p>

							<p>These tools are giving scores based on an algorithm. For example, my score is dinged because I have too many internal links in my site navigation. A user navigating the regional site by keyboard will actually skip all of the navigation links unless they activate the menu.</p>

							<p>It's also not possible to automate all accessibility testing. If you embed text within an image there's no way for SiteImprove to detect an error. A certain amount of manual review is required; the more you test your site with different methods of navigation the better you'll serve your users.</p>

						<p><a href="https://www.fws.gov/southeast">fws.gov/southeast</a></p>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Google introduced Lighthouse, a webpage auditing tool to their developer panel in the last year or so. Lighthouse operates page-by-page rather than crawling your entire site like SiteImprove. This is a great way to quickly audit how you're doing after building a new page or making substantial edits.</p>

							<p>It's important to understand what you have control over, too. If you check out my lighthouse score you'll notice I have plenty of room to improve in areas of performance and best practices. Unfortuantely many of those settings are handled at the Web Server level in Denver.</p>

							<p>The key point here is that the more you're aware of your website's shortfalls the more likely you are to make improvements.</p>
